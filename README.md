### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Canadian-born South African who's currently a computer science student at the University of Pretoria. Most of my time is spent trying to get my code to work or pouring over textbooks as I try and get my degree.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduating. It's a lot harder than it looks<br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of new things. So is the life of a computer science major.<br/>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with compiler construction. If anyone could help me, please do.<br/>
