### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Canadian-born South African who's currently a part-time computer science honours student at the University of Pretoria and full-time software engineer. Most of my time is spent trying to get my code to work or pouring over textbooks as I try and get my degree.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduating. It's a lot harder than it looks<br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of new things. So is the life of a computer science major.<br/>
